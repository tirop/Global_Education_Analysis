# Global Education Analysis (2007-2022)
### Using SQL & Tableau to Identify EdTech Market Opportunities

## Overview
This project explores global education trends from **2007 to 2022** using **SQL** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and **Tableau** for data visualization. The goal is to uncover **EdTech market opportunities** by analyzing education levels, GDP, and trends in schooling improvements.

The project consists of two main parts:  
1️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL** – Data cleaning, aggregation, and key insights.  
2️ **Tableau Dashboard** – Visualizing insights for business decision-making.

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
- **Objective:** Identify global education trends and potential EdTech markets.
- **Process:**  
    Data Cleaning (handling nulls, filtering data)  
    Aggregation (calculating schooling averages, GDP trends)  
    Key Insights (countries improving education the fastest, wealth-education correlations)

### 2. Tableau Dashboard – Data Visualization
- **Objective:** Convert key EDA insights into a business-focused visual dashboard.
- **Visuals Include:**  
    Scatterplot (Education vs. GDP)  
    Bar chart (Top 10 fastest-improving education systems)  
    Correlation metric (Wealth & Education relationship)

## Key Takeaways & Business Insights
- **Premium EdTech Market Targets:** Wealthy countries with **low schooling years** (e.g., Antigua & Barbuda, Equatorial Guinea) offer premium EdTech opportunities.
- **Government Partnership Potential:** Countries with **fast education growth** (e.g., Montenegro, Timor-Leste) are prime candidates for public-private EdTech collaborations.
- **Wealth-Education Correlation:** A **moderate positive correlation (0.41)** exists between GDP & education, but **exceptions create niche opportunities** for both high-end and budget-friendly EdTech solutions.
