## Dashboard Structure
| Panel | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wealth vs. Education Scatterplot** | This maps average years of schooling against GDP per capita. The color indicates GDP bucket (low, medium, high). This helps identify wealthy countries with **low schooling**, which highlights possible **EdTech opportunities**. |
| **Top 10 Education Improvers** | This section highlights countries with the **fastest annual schooling improvements** from 2007-2022. It signals strong **government reform** and **partnership potential**. |
| **Wealth-Education Correlation Summary** | This part displays the calculated correlation between GDP and schooling, which shows a **moderate positive relationship** (0.41). Outliers are highlighted to uncover **niche opportunities**. |

## Key Insights
- **Premium Markets:** Wealthy countries with low schooling years (like Antigua & Barbuda and Equatorial Guinea) represent premium private EdTech opportunities.
- **Reform Hotspots:** Countries rapidly improving education systems (like Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzigovina, Antigua & Barbudam, and Timor-Leste) signal strong government investment. This is ideal for possible EdTech investment or EdTech-government partnerships.
-  **Global Trend:** There is a moderate positive correlation (0.41) between GDP and schooling, but outliers create unique opportunities for localized solutions.
